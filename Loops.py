'''
Python counting script.
count = 0 creates a keyword of "count" and sets that to 0
while count < 6:  tells the code to do something while the code is less than 6
    print(count)  tells code to display the current count
    count += 1    tells code to add 1 to sequence the code from 0 at 1 interval
'''
count = 0
while count < 10000000000000000:
    print(count)
    count += 1

'''
End result, created a loop that automatically counts from 0 to 5 and then stops

print("Finished")
